- Definitely not planed but the plan has planned itself.
- I will be using this repository to write mostly vanilla-javascript as i aim to be extremely efficient in my use of javascript. I will do this as often as i can but hopefully we recognize the results with time.
- Just installed a  spell checker now the problem is it will make my writing of isizulu hard, Yabanona nje
- The Goal : Build a website everyweek using just HTML/CSS/JAVASCRIPT, This will close the I'm not good enough gap. Now i have no direct need for anymore online courses on these mentioned languaged, the just build box -> I tick that(supahot fire).
- The Bar : I will build presentation worthy websites so that i don't end up building the same useless stuff over and over again. Ohhh, maybe I should define what i will build and what the website should be able to do before i start building everyweek.

- Build an Interactive website.
- `the bar ` i build an website that takes in users inputs then uses that input to calculate the probability of the childs gender then outputs the results. 
- Honed in on my :hover skills. I had to manipulate the DOM which is something i think i should get familiar with as its the way to use javascript through getting somthing from the document using id,class,ect. Also solved for outputing javascript variables in html.innerHTML

# 12_feb
- Impliment Data Structures and algorithems.
- `the bar` built a <bold>Tic Tac Toe</bold> game. solved a few problems along the way like assigning the value to the drop down select, so that when i get element value i can use that assined value which i made equall to the id off the corresponding bo on the game board.
- question: does javascript execute all lines in an if-statement?, because i have a false condition(which i expect javascript to skip) but instead javascript is returning an error from that false condition.

- Goal - build an website with navigation to second page(at minimum).
- Javascript is just failing at connecting between 2 HTML Documents, I ahve tried to move around but it's not working, This is a very serious limiting thing for posibilities of my weekly project. The solution is out there though and i will find it.
    - Found the solution put it's a bad one because i won't be able to apply css to the -module, so i haven't actuall solve the problem. progress

# 26_feb
- Goal - A ticket selling website.

# 4_march
- amazon interview
- not everything is to be stored in an array. Data Structures and Algorithems.
- the course of this project might change, I got the *amazon* intern role for *sofware developer engineer*, so in adjusting for that and career alignment(meaning as i grow i need to do harder stuff), march will now be dedicated towards designing what course of action I should take for the rest of the year.
- Data Structure and Algorithems are the important topic i'm really trying to incorparate in my adventure.
- maybe just naming the folder with website name instead of dates is an better approach than using dates.
